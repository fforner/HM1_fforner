PYTHON REFRESHER/INTRO TO GITHUB

Part 1:

Create a Python application that uses the NumPy and MatPlotLib libraries to create and display a graph of one period of the Sine and Cosine functions on the same set of axes. This should include a title, a legend and a color coding for each function. Once your function runs successfully, create a git project and upload your code.

Part 2:

Work with your group to assign each person an "developer". The maintainer should add the Tangent function to the list of functions supported by the script. Once this is complete, the maintainer should make a Pull Request.

Part 3:

The original owner of the repository should review the Pull Request. If it is satisfactory, accept the Pull Request. If not, recommend changes following the guidelines in "How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human". (https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/ (Links to an external site.))

Once all 3 parts are complete, submit your github repository link to this assignment. You may submit your assignment even before the Pull Request is accepted, but the assignment will not be graded until it is.
